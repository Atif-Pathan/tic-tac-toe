# tic-tac-toe

### **Try it: https://atif-pathan.github.io/tic-tac-toe/**

A quick tic-tac-toe game I built to learn more about and implement, `Objects` in Javascript as well as `Factory Functions` and the `Module Pattern`. I have implemented multiple factories as well as IIFEs to complete this project. 

### Potential areas I want to improve upon later:

Currently, it doesnt allow to restart in the middle of the game. There is also no Computer to play against, so _you will need 2 players_.
